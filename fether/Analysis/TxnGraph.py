    Create a snapshot of the Ethereum network.

    Description:
    ------------
    Create a snapshot, which contains a graph, out of transactions stored in a
    mongo collection. Each snapshot must start at some time t0 (start_block)
    and end at time tf (end_block). It will include all nodes that sent or
    received a transaction between t0 and tf.


    Parameters:
    -----------
    start_block <int>              # The lower bound of the block range to
                                   # be analysed.
    end_block <int>                # The upper range of the block range to
                                   # be analysed.
    previous <dict>                # Previous graph and its end_block
    snap <bool> (default=True)     # Build the graph upon instantiation.
    save <bool> (default=True)     # Save the graph automatically
    load <bool> (default=False)    # Skip building the graph and load a


    Usage:
    ------
    Initialize with a previous graph:

        g = TxnGraph(previous={graph: <Graph>, end_block: <int>})

    Draw the image (saved by default to DATADIR/snapshots/a_b.png,
    where a=start_block, b=end_block):

        g.draw()

    Save the state of the object (including the graph):

        g.save()

    Load a graph with start_block=a, end_block=b from DATADIR if it exists:

        g.load(a, b)
